Edit Yaesu FT3d `MEMORY.dat` file.

Current project status is that I am almost completed mapping all the fields in the `MEMORY.dat` file. When that is completed, it will be quick work to setup the import / export so that the tool can be used to convert from .csv -> .dat and back.

# Remaining work:
- Some fields remain unattributed
- Export to .csv format
- Import from .csv
- re-export back to `MEMORY.dat`
